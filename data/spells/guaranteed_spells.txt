--- These spells / spells sets are randomized in following way
--- 1. handle chanceincs
--- 2. pick a random set
--- return to 1
--- 
--- Thus all sets that have a positive weight will be chosen, but if you make sets exclude other sets, they will not be picked even if they originally had a positive weight
--- (No ways to do that as of now)
---
--- Some of the stuff here can also be in random spells for stuff that should occasionally be available for nearly any nation.
--- Random spells is a better place for such stuff since that stuff is on a different quota.
