--- Baseflags should generally be given names so that other parts can be limited to use just them
--- with #allowed <name>. If there are no #allowed commands, the part is expected to fit all flags. 

--- Baseflag 1 
- Square with three flaps at bottom

#new
#name "baseflag1"
#sprite "./graphics/flags/baseflag_1.png"
#recolormask "./graphics/flags/baseflag_1_recolormask.png"
#basechance 1
#end


--- Baseflag 2 
- Square with two flaps at bottom

#new
#name "baseflag2"
#sprite "./graphics/flags/baseflag_2.png"
#recolormask "./graphics/flags/baseflag_2_recolormask.png"
#basechance 1
#end


--- Baseflag 3 
- Triangle
- Only about 25% of flags will have the triangle shape thanks to basechance 0.66 (because 0.66 / (1 + 1 + 0.66) = ~0.25)

#new
#name "baseflag3"
#sprite "./graphics/flags/baseflag_3.png"
#recolormask "./graphics/flags/baseflag_3_recolormask.png"
#basechance 0.66
#end
