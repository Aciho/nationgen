This file lists special commands that can be used in race/pose/item/filter files that aren't necessarily so obvious.
Commands that appear in both races and poses prioritize using the one in the pose if both are found unless otherwise mentioned.

stacks multiplicatively.

--- Filters, magic items, names etc
#type <string>
Units/nations/whatever can have only one filter of a type.

#primarycommand <command>
When checking if we're trying to add something that won't change the unit, we only consider commands marked with #primarycommand. For example a filter giving #ethereal and #gcost +15 will trigger on an ethereal unit thanks to the gold cost changing the unit. However, if you set #primarycommand #ethereal, only #ethereal will be considered and thus an ethereal unit won't get the filter in question.

#commanderonly
#trooponly
Only works for nation wide filters. Applies the filter only to commanders or only to troops.

#alwaysok
Only for mage names. Always accepts this name part even if it does not match the required magic.
